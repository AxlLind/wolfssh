WOLFCRYPT

This directory is provided as a convenience for the test and sample
tools to find the wolfSSL library and headers.

The library should just be copied into this directory with the name
`wolfssl.lib`. The headers that come with the library are in the
directory `wolfssl` and `wolfssl\wolfcrypt`. That wolfssl directory
should be copied here.

The following is a subset of files and the directories they live in,
as an example.

  src\ssh.c
  src\internal.c
  wolfcrypt\readme.txt (this file)
  wolfcrypt\wolfssl.lib
  wolfcrypt\wolfssl\ssl.h
  wolfcrypt\wolfssl\options.h
  wolfcrypt\wolfssl\wolfcrypt\aes.h
  wolfcrypt\wolfssl\wolfcrypt\user_settings.h
